6.0.2 (2020-11-23)
------------------

6.0.1 (2020-11-17)
------------------
* Disable treating compiler warnings as errors due to buildfarm failure on Debian Stretch
  This change will result in "unstable" build notifications from the buildfarm but prevent failures.

------------------
* Upgrade standard to C++14 for new pybind11 version
* Updates and fixes, including speed optimisation, to many areas including: DynamicsSolver, DynamicTimeIndexedShootingProblem, CollisionScene (now instantiable), support for instantiating geometry shapes, meshes, and octrees from initialisers, etc.
* Added support for kinematic Hessians
* New integration schemes for dynamic problems: symplectic integrators; added state transition function
* Add support for dynamic task maps, i.e., those that depend on both x (configuration+velocity) and u (control)
* Add sparse costs
* Add a second BoxQP
* Meshcat visualisation
* Joint velocity and acceleration limits
