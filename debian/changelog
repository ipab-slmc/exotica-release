ros-kinetic-exotica-core (6.0.0-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Upgrade standard to C++14 for new pybind11 version
  * Updates and fixes, including speed optimisation, to many areas including: DynamicsSolver, DynamicTimeIndexedShootingProblem, CollisionScene (now instantiable), support for instantiating geometry shapes, meshes, and octrees from initialisers, etc.
  * Added support for kinematic Hessians
  * New integration schemes for dynamic problems: symplectic integrators; added state transition function
  * Add support for dynamic task maps, i.e., those that depend on both x (configuration+velocity) and u (control)
  * Add sparse costs
  * Add a second BoxQP
  * Meshcat visualisation
  * Joint velocity and acceleration limits
  * Contributors: Matt Timmons-Brown, Traiko Dinev, Vladimir Ivan, Wolfgang Merkt
